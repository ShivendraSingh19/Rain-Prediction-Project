# Rain-Prediction-Project
[Jan 2025]

This project was completed as part of the Honors segment of the IBM Machine Learning Course on Coursera.

### Developed a classifier to predict whether it will rain the next day.
Utilized a rainfall dataset provided by the Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology. The data was cleaned and preprocessed, followed by the application of various classification algorithms. These algorithms were used to build a model based on the training data, and the testing data was evaluated using multiple performance metrics.

The following classification algorithms were employed: 
Linear Regression
KNN
Decision Trees
Logistic Regression
SVM
Evaluated the models using:

Accuracy Score
Jaccard Index
F1-Score
LogLoss
Mean Absolute Error
Mean Squared Error
R2-Score
